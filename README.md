 ## Bugs

   - Firstly I created a second page to create a how to section, but with my mentors insipration I decided to change to a model, I used the W3C page to learn how to do 
     this, and I feel this is a great was to convey the relivent information to the user, and 
   - Following the the first game and after resetting I found that the game didnt run as it did before, the scores were adding wrong and and not resetting correctly.
      to overcome this, I corrected the event listeners for both the play and reset buttons, so that the game would reset properly and the play button would also work as before.
   - There were various minor errors in the HTML and JS code that I was quickly able to discover, because I was running my code through the W3 validation services and 
     jshint.com at periodic points, making sure the code was right. I also used the Google Developer Tools to test and iron out little kinks in my HTML and CSS code.
